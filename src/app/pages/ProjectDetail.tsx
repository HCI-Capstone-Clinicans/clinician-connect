Working alongside Dr. Carroll and two attending residents, the robot completed 12 precision incision tests with sub-millimeter accuracy across every run.\n\nWhat struck the team most wasn't just the technical performance, but how naturally the system integrated into existing surgical workflows. The residents barely had to adjust their posture. There's still refinement ahead, but this trial confirmed we're building something that could genuinely work in clinical practice — not just in theory.",

      body: "We brought in six surgical residents for our second round of usability testing, and the conversations were more candid — and more useful — than I expected. The overall response to the haptic feedback was genuinely positive. Participants described the tactile cues as 'intuitive' and said they felt less cognitively burdened compared to traditional setups.\n\nThe one friction point that kept surfacing: the alert system. When RoboDog flags a potential issue, the notification appears in the same visual zone regardless of where the surgeon is looking. Two participants missed alerts entirely during high-focus moments. We're now rethinking the alert logic to be spatially aware — tying notifications to the surgeon's gaze direction using the camera feed. It's a non-trivial change, but the testing made clear it matters.",

      body: "One of the quieter challenges on the RoboDog project has been response latency — the gap between a surgeon's input and the robot's physical reaction. For most software, 120 milliseconds is imperceptible. In surgery, it isn't.\n\nThis month, we tracked the delay down to the servo motor assembly on the primary arm. The original components were rated for general-purpose robotics, not real-time haptic feedback. After swapping in a higher-resolution servo set and rewriting the motion interpolation layer, we brought latency down to 34ms — well within the threshold where surgeons report the system feeling 'immediate.'\n\nWe also patched an edge case in the depth sensor firmware that caused occasional signal drops during lateral movement. It only triggered in about 3% of sessions, but in a surgical context, 3% is unacceptable. The fix is live and we haven't seen a drop since.",

It made practical sense — residents are easier to schedule and more familiar with participating in research. But we always knew it was a limitation.\n\nThis month, our IRB amendment was approved to expand the participant pool to include attending surgeons. This is a meaningful shift. Attendings bring decades of ingrained technique and much higher expectations for any tool they're asked to use. If RoboDog earns their trust, that's a far stronger signal than resident approval alone.\n\nWe're coordinating the expanded scheduling now and aiming to begin attending-level sessions in April. The richer dataset this produces will be central to our upcoming publication.",
